## Upcoming

### October 2020 Transcribe-a-thon
**Please join us for round two of our Soul of Reason virtual transcribe-a-thon!**
NYU Libraries' collection of radio broadcasts, created by Dr. Roscoe Brown, showcased Black and Puerto Rican art, scholarship, and life in New York City from 1971-1978. These recordings are part of the Records of the Institute of African American Affairs in NYU Special Collections. 

Interested individuals can sign up to hand-correct an auto-generated transcription of an audio recording from the Soul of Reason recordings in NYU Special Collections. 🙋🏽‍♀️  
Transcripts will be assigned and available to participants to work on any time over the course of two weeks, 10/19-10/30. 📝  
After a training session on Monday 10/19, project organizers will be available via Zoom office hours on 10/21 and 10/28, or via Slack and email.   💬
