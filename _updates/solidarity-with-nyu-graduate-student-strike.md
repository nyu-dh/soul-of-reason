On Monday, April 26, GSOC-UAW Local 2110, the Union for Graduate Employees at NYU, went on strike. They are striking to demand a living wage, protection from all forms of discrimination and harassment, adequate healthcare, protections for international workers, and healthy and safe working conditions.

You can learn more about the strike, the current bargaining issues, and GSOC's demands on their [strike website](https://makingabetternyu.org/resources/#support). In solidarity with our striking colleagues--and in accordance with [GSOC's requests for support from Faculty, Supervisors and Mangers](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LzbNzIGUhJ6VX1GYMDJhFm_-F3yPXrn0/view)--we have decided to postpone Amplifying the Soul of Reason: A Virtual Wiki Edit-a-thon from May 8th to a date in June. Stay tuned for the information about the rescheduled date. We hope to see you there.

Should you be able to contribute to it, GSOC-UAW has established [a mutual aid fund for striking workers](https://opencollective.com/gsoc-uaw-local-2110/contribute/donation-to-gsoc-uaw-local-2110-hardship-mutual-aid-fund-for-striking-workers-27671) to supplement lost income and to provide assistance for housing, food, and other necessities throughout the duration of the strike.
